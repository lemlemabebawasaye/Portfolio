            <p><em>MDPI Processes, 2025</em></p>
            <p>This study examines pipeline incident risks by predicting emergency shutdown durations using machine learning. Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
		    were applied to PHMSA data (2010–2022), capturing complex patterns beyond traditional methods. LightGBM achieved 75.0% accuracy, with Random Forest close at 74.8%. 
		    Explainable AI techniques, like SHAP values, identified key factors affecting shutdowns, including pipeline material, age, and layout. These insights aid pipeline 
		    operators and regulators in making data-driven decisions to enhance safety and reduce disruptions.

      <p><em>ASCE Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities,  December 16</em>, 2024</p>
      <p>This study examines pipeline incidents that disrupt global energy transport, emphasizing the limitations of past research, which typically used simple statistical methods 
	      or relied heavily on expert opinions. By employing association rule mining on data from the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration, this research identifies 
	      complex relationships among incident causes, pipeline features, failure types, and shutdown periods. Results show that combinations of factors, such as older, large-diameter 
	      pipelines located underground, increase the likelihood of mechanical damage and longer shutdowns due to excavation incidents. These insights are valuable for improving pipeline 
	      planning, design, and operational safety, highlighting the need for targeted prevention strategies to ensure reliable energy transportation.</p>

      <p><em>Construction and Building Materials, December 25</em>, 2024</p>
      <p>This study investigates how the size of coarse aggregates affects the bond between steel reinforcement and concrete, which is crucial for the strength of reinforced 
	      concrete structures, particularly at beam-column joints. Using pullout tests, the research compares aggregate sizes from 9.5 mm to 37.5 mm and also tests pure mortar samples. 
	      Results indicate that smaller aggregates significantly reduce bond strength, with mortar achieving only 38.65% of the strength compared to concrete with 25 mm aggregates. 
	      Existing bond prediction models perform well for larger aggregates but are less accurate for smaller sizes. This research underscores the importance of considering aggregate size 
	      in structural design and suggests further study on aggregate shape and moisture content to enhance bond strength predictions.</p>

                <h3>Detecting red-flag bidding patterns in low-bid procurement for highway projects with pattern mining</h3>
             </a>
           <p>Lemlem Asaye </strong>, Muhammad Ali Moriyani, Chau Le, Tuyen Le</p>
           <p><em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of Management in Engineering, October 26</em> , 2023</p>
            <p>This study investigates bid collusion in highway project procurement, where competitive bidding aims to secure the lowest project costs but can be compromised by collusive arrangements. 
		    Traditional detection methods rely on engineers’ estimates and bid cost similarities, which experienced colluders can manipulate. To address these limitations, this research introduces 
		    a data-driven Collusion Red-Flag Detection (CRFD) framework using pattern mining and statistical analysis. The framework identifies contractors with unusual winning patterns, particularly 
		    when specific bidders are present. Additionally, it integrates influential factors to improve detection accuracy. This approach provides project owners with an effective tool for early 
		    collusion detection, supporting better decision-making in awarding contracts. </p>

          </p> <em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of Management in Engineering, October 05</em> , 2023</p>
          <p> This study examines competitive bidding in design-bid-build highway construction contracts, highlighting the limitations of traditional evaluation methods that focus solely on the number of bidders. 
	      It introduces a data-driven network theory approach to assess competition from the perspective of project owners. By modeling competition as a bidirected network based on past winning and losing records, 
		  the study develops new centrality measures to evaluate bidder competitiveness. These measures show stronger correlations with bidding performance than the traditional bidder count. The findings provide 
		  state highway agencies with a more comprehensive understanding of competition, supporting improved decision-making in project bidding processes. </p>

           <p>  This study investigates the use of Ambo stone as a coarse aggregate and fly ash as a cement replacement to create sustainable concrete. Fly ash reduces cement consumption and improves workability, 
		while Ambo stone offers a lightweight alternative. Experiments with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% Ambo stone replacement and 15% fly ash showed increased strength at 25% and 50% replacement, with 25% 
		being optimal. XRD and SEM analyses confirm fly ash’s amorphous structure. This research highlights fly ash’s potential to enhance concrete performance while reducing environmental impact.</p>

           <p><em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Computing in Civil Engineering 2025, January 25</em>, 2025</p>
            <p> This study addresses the risks of aging pipelines and the limitations of traditional risk models that ignore cumulative failures. Using recurrent event survival analysis with Prentice, Williams,

	       Analyzing PHMSA and USEIA data (2010–2022), it identifies failure hotspots. The Cox PH model (concordance index: 0.73) shows hotspot pipelines have twice the failure risk (hazard ratio: 2.089),
