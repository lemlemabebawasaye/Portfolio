              <h3>Transformer-Based Optimized Multimodal Fusion for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</h3>
            </a>
            <p><strong>Simegnew Alaba</strong> and John E. Ball</p>
            <p><em>IEEE Access, April 5, 2024</em></p>
            <p>3D object detection is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a detailed perception of the environment
	through multiple sensors. Cameras excel at capturing color and texture but struggle with depth and under adverse weather
	or lighting conditions. LiDAR sensors offer accurate depth information but lack visual detail. To overcome these limitations, 
	this work introduces a multimodal fusion model that combines data from LiDAR and cameras for improved 3D object detection.
       The model transforms camera images and LiDAR point cloud data into a voxel-based representation and uses encoder networks to
	enhance spatial interactions. A multiresolution attention module and discrete wavelet transforms are incorporated to improve feature extraction,
	merging LiDAR's depth with the camera's texture and color details. The model also uses a transformer decoder network with self-attention and 
	cross-attention for robust object detection through global interactions.
	Advanced optimization techniques like pruning and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) reduce memory and computational demands while maintaining 
	performance. Testing on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates the model's effectiveness, providing competitive results and improved operational efficiency
	in multimodal fusion 3D object detection.

      <p><strong>Simegnew Alaba </strong> and John E. Ball</p>
      <p><em>IEEE SoutheastCon,  April 24,</em>, 2024</p>
      <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at extracting complex features from images,
	but conventional CNNs process entire images uniformly, which can be inefficient since not
	all regions are equally important. To address this, the Wavelet Convolutional Attention Module (WCAM) 
	focuses CNNs on crucial features, using wavelets' multiresolution and sparsity to guide efficient
	      downsampling without losing details.</p>
