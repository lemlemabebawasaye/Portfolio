      <p><em>This study explores the role of natural language processing (NLP) in strengthening infrastructure resilience against natural disasters. While NLP has shown promise in analyzing unstructured 
	      data for emergency decision-making, such as detecting infrastructure damage, research on its broader applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study conducts a scientometric 
	      review using bibliographic records from Scopus and Web of Science. The analysis identifies key trends, developments, challenges, and future opportunities in NLP-based infrastructure resilience 
	      research. By mapping the global research landscape, this study enhances understanding of NLP’s potential to improve disaster response and infrastructure protection.</p>

                <h3>Detecting red-flag bidding patterns in low-bid procurement for highway projects with pattern mining</h3>
             </a>
           <p><strong>Lemlem Asaye </strong>, Muhammad Ali Moriyani, Chau Le, Tuyen Le</p>
           <p><em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of Management in Engineering, October 26</em> , 2023</p>
            <p>This study investigates bid collusion in highway project procurement, where competitive bidding aims to secure the lowest project costs but can be compromised by collusive arrangements. 
		    Traditional detection methods rely on engineers’ estimates and bid cost similarities, which experienced colluders can manipulate. To address these limitations, this research introduces 
		    a data-driven Collusion Red-Flag Detection framework using pattern mining and statistical analysis. The framework identifies contractors with unusual winning patterns, particularly 
		    when specific bidders are present. Additionally, it integrates influential factors to improve detection accuracy. This approach provides project owners with an effective tool for early 
		    collusion detection, supporting better decision-making in awarding contracts. </p>

          </p> <em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of Management in Engineering, October 05</em> , 2023</p>
          <p> This study examines competitive bidding in design-bid-build highway construction contracts, highlighting the limitations of traditional evaluation methods that focus solely on the number of bidders. 
	      It introduces a data-driven network theory approach to assess competition from the perspective of project owners. By modeling competition as a bidirected network based on past winning and losing records, 
		  the study develops new centrality measures to evaluate bidder competitiveness. These measures show stronger correlations with bidding performance than the traditional bidder count. The findings provide 
		  state highway agencies with a more comprehensive understanding of competition, supporting improved decision-making in project bidding processes. </p>

          <p> <em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Computing in Civil Engineering 2023, January 25</em>, 2024 </p>
          <p>This study examines pipeline incidents that have caused shutdowns and economic losses, emphasizing the need to understand their causes and impacts. Using data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
	     Administration (PHMSA), this research applies association rule mining to uncover relationships between incident causes, background factors such as materials, and shutdown durations. Unlike previous studies that 
	     relied on simple statistical analyses, this approach provides deeper insights into how multiple factors interact. The findings are expected to contribute to better pipeline planning, design, and operations by 
	     identifying key risk factors and informing preventive measures to enhance infrastructure reliability. </p>

           <p><em>Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, June 15</em>, 2020</p>
           <p>  This study investigates the use of Ambo stone as a coarse aggregate and fly ash as a cement replacement to create sustainable concrete. Fly ash reduces cement consumption and improves workability, 
		while Ambo stone offers a lightweight alternative. Experiments with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% Ambo stone replacement and 15% fly ash showed increased strength at 25% and 50% replacement, with 25% 
		being optimal. XRD and SEM analyses confirm fly ash’s amorphous structure. This research highlights fly ash’s potential to enhance concrete performance while reducing environmental impact.</p>

           <p><strong>Lemlem Asaye</strong>,  Chau Le, Trung Q. Le, Om Prakash Yadav, and Tuyen Le </p>
           <p><em>American Society of Civil Engineers, Computing in Civil Engineering 2025, January 25</em>, 2025</p>
            <p> This study addresses the risks of aging pipelines and the limitations of traditional risk models that ignore cumulative failures. Using recurrent event survival analysis with Prentice, Williams, 
		and Peterson models, it examines incident data from PHMSA and network attributes from USEIA. Findings show survival probabilities drop sharply in the first year, with 35.66% of failures 
		linked to equipment defects and operational errors. Subsequent failures accelerate deterioration, highlighting the need for frequent inspections. The proposed approach provides a more accurate 
		risk assessment and supports proactive maintenance strategies.</p>

           <p> This study explores how geographic variations affect pipeline longevity using spatial (Getis-Ord Gi*) and survival analysis (Prentice-Williams-Peterson and Cox Proportional Hazards models). 
	       Analyzing PHMSA and USEIA data (2010–2022), it identifies failure hotspots. The Cox PH model (concordance index: 0.73) shows hotspot pipelines have twice the failure risk (hazard ratio: 2.089), 
	       while the Midwest faces a fourfold risk increase. Findings highlight the need for region-specific maintenance and material strategies to improve pipeline reliability.</p>

		  underwent characterization and cyclic loading tests. Key factors analyzed include deviatoric stress, confining stress, and water content. Results indicate that Mr is highly influenced by these 
		  factors, with optimal water content improving shear resistance and elastic deformation under certain stress levels. In contrast, soils outside this range exhibit complete plastic deformation.</p>
